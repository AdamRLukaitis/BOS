These are my two OSLoaders, one for a FAT16 HDD and one for PXE TFTP

The FAT16 HDD includes MBR and VBR.

PXE loader requires /pxeboot.cfg
FAT16 loader requires /boot/boot.cfg

Both of these configs are Identical!

The Config file is as follows:

[ASCII_CODE][INFORMATION]
FilePaths end in a ';'

The availible ASCII_CODEs are:
K - Load ELF Kernel
k - Load BIN Kernel (will load to 0x00100000)
M - Load Module
V - Video Mode Request
B - Boot Kernel

NOTE a Kernel MUST be loaded before any modules!

after the ASCII_CODE to load a file there are NO spaces just a FilePath ending with a ';'
E.G.
kbos/kernel.bin
Kbos/kernel.elf
Mbos/mods/mymod.dll

The Video Mode Request is in the following format

V[WIDTH][HEIGHT][LFB][DEPTH]

WIDTH = 4 ASCII Hex
HEIGHT = 4 ASCII Hex
LFB = 2 ASCII Hex (01 = LFB, 00 = no LFB)
DEPTH = 2 ASCII Hex (bit depth)

E.G.
Video mode 640X480X32bpp with LFB would be
V028001E00120

The Boot Kernel Code is the last thing to get processed,
upon recieving it will switch to 32-bit protected mode and jump to the kernel.
