This code is all a work in progress!




This code DOES NOT WORK AS-IS!
DO NOT USE ON REAL HARDWARE!





Any code that is not commented should be considered highly volatile!

Code that is commented should not be considered static, as bugs fixes and
optimizations may still remain; but this code *should* function from the
outside with the same matter as before.

make - requires root, and only tested under Ubuntu based distros.

make build - builds the system
make install - puts system on image
make clean - removes objects AND BINARIES
make run - runs Bochs




This code DOES NOT WORK AS-IS!
DO NOT USE ON REAL HARDWARE!
